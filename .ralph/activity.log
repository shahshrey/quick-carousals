[00:53:30] 💬 ASSISTANT: The dev server is returning 500, which means there's an error. According to the rules, I must **FIX SERVICE ISSUES FIRST** before proceeding. Let me diagnose the issue:...

[00:54:41] EDIT .env.local
[00:54:46] 💬 ASSISTANT: Now let me try to start the dev server in the background and check if it starts properly:...

[00:55:08] 💬 ASSISTANT: I'm already in the `apps/nextjs` directory. Let me start the dev server from here:...

echo $! > /tmp/nextjs-dev.pid
sleep 5
cat /tmp/nextjs-dev.log | tail -20 → exit 0
[00:55:22] 💬 ASSISTANT: The dotenv command is failing. Let me check the package.json scripts and run it differently:...
[00:55:25] SHELL cat ../../.env.local && echo "---env.local exists---" → exit 0
[00:55:30] 💬 ASSISTANT: Good, the .env.local exists. The issue is with the dotenv command. Let me try a different approach - just run next dev directly with the environment variables:...

echo $! > /tmp/nextjs-dev.pid
sleep 8
cat /tmp/nextjs-dev.log | tail -30 → exit 0

[00:56:07] SHELL dotenv --help | head -20 → exit 0
[00:56:14] 💬 ASSISTANT: Perfect! I need to use `dotenv run` command. Let me update the approach:...
[00:56:25] SHELL cd apps/nextjs && dotenv -f ../../.env.local run next dev > /tmp/nextjs-dev.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > /tmp/nextjs-dev.pid
sleep 8
tail -40 /tmp/nextjs-dev.log → exit 0
[00:56:38] 💬 ASSISTANT: The dotenv tool is looking for `next` in the wrong path. Let me use a different approach - just export the environment variables and run next directly:...
[00:56:49] SHELL cd apps/nextjs && (export $(cat ../../.env.local | grep -v '^#' | xargs) && npx next dev) > /tmp/nextjs-dev.log 2>&1 &

tail -40 /tmp/nextjs-dev.log → exit 0
[00:56:55] 💬 ASSISTANT: The shell cd seems to not be working as expected. Let me use the working_directory parameter:...

[00:57:37] 💬 ASSISTANT: The error shows that the `@saasfly/auth` package is missing. This is likely a dependencies issue. Let me install the dependencies from the workspace root:...
[00:57:49] SHELL bun install → exit 0
[00:57:56] 💬 ASSISTANT: Great! Dependencies installed. Now let me kill the old process and start a fresh dev server:...

rm -f /tmp/nextjs-dev.pid /tmp/nextjs-dev.log

[00:58:22] 💬 ASSISTANT: The environment validation is failing. Let me check the env.mjs file and update the .env.local with the required variables:...
[00:58:26] READ apps/nextjs/src/env.mjs (50 lines, 0B)
[00:58:35] 💬 ASSISTANT: I see. The env.mjs requires GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET, and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET. Let me update the .env.local file with these required variables:...
[00:58:37] EDIT .env.local
[00:58:43] 💬 ASSISTANT: Now let me start the dev server again:...
